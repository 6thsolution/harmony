Harmony Logging Mechanism

## Installation

Add the following lines to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  harmony_log: ^latest.version
```

import harmony_log.

```dart
import 'package:harmony_log/harmony_log.dart';
```

## Usage

Log system contains two main blocks, A logger which is represented using `Log` class, and an output which is represented
using `LogOutput` class.

Each log request on `Log` class is transformed to a `LogEvent` by adding identification and time information, and is
redirected to the given `LogOutput`. `LogEvent`s contain `message`, `error`, `stackTrace` and `level` (which is
represented using `LogLevel` enum) as well as some extra information like `id` (which is generated by the given `LogId`)
, `time` and `extra`. `extra` is a general field with type `Object` which is reserved for adding extra information to a
log event.

A `LogId` is needed for `Log` class to generate an id for each log event. You can use its standard
implementation `LogId()` which is based on `uuid v1` uuid generation. there other types of LogId factories like
`counter` which will simply count from a starting value, `constant` which will always generate the same given id
and `custom` which you can provide your custom logic for id generation. You can check out on dart docs.

As well as a generic `log` method on `Log` class you have access to helper methods
`v`, `d`, `i`, `w`, `e` and `wtf` which add `level` according to their acronyms. You have also access to `write` method
on `Log` class which is a low level method to directly specify log events. `LogLevel` enum has 6 different log levels
like `LogLevel.verbose` with significance of `0` and `LogLevel.wtf` with significance of `5`. `LogLevel`s are comparable
using `compareTo` method or comparison operators like `>=`.

Each `Log` class should be initialized using `init` and closed using `close`. After calling `init` it should be
immediately usable. But after calling close the behaviour is unspecified meaning using log after being closed can
actually log events, don't log events without giving an error or throwing an error. Also closing may be finished
asynchronously. you must call logging methods after calling `init` and before calling `close`. `init` and `close`
commands are redirected to `LogOutput`.

`Log` class is created by providing a `LogOutput`, `LogId` and a `tag` to its constructor. tag is by default null. it is
recommended that you create one `Log` class with null tag for your app log, then create tagged loggers from your logger
using `tagged` method. This has the advantage to using the same output and id generation systems, So by initializing one
them all of them are initialized and the same for closing.

`LogOutput`s are created using its factories. Some of the outputs are responsible to redirect events to other outputs,
like `filtered` to filter events and redirect to other output, `multi` to output to multiple other outputs, `redirect`
to redirect output to other output conditionally and `redirectOnDebug` to redirect output to other output only on debug.
Some of them are terminal outputs like `noop` which does not do anything. And there is a special `custom` output which
can be used to create custom outputs by providing functions for `init`, `write` and `close` operations. And a
special `plain` factory which is used to output plain `String` data.

Filtering events is done by using special `filtered` LogOutput factory. You should provide and output for filtered
events to go to and a `LogFilter` to filter events. `LogFilter`s are created using its factories, for example `level`
which will allow levels equal or greater than the specified level, `all` which will allow all events, `none` which won't
allow any events, `debug` which will allow events only on debug, and several other factories which you can check out on
dart docs. And there is a `custom` factory which is used to create custom filtering logic. All LogFilters support
standard set operations like `|`, `&`, `-` and `!`.

Plain output is where you will output logs to for example console and file. Outputting plain data is done by using
special `plain` LogOutput factory. You should provide a `LogPlainFilter` and a `LogPlainOutput`.

`LogPlainFilter` is responsible for transforming a log event to a list of string lines. It can be created using its
factories like `simple` which will format a simple single-line output, `pretty` which will format events in a box like
view, `json` which will format events in json. `json` formatter is specially good when outputting to a
file. `LogPlainFilter` will also add start and end sequences to log output, for example in json we need `[`and `]` at
start and end of file to be meaningful. There is a `custom` factory which you can use to implement your custom
formatting mechanism.

`LogPlainOutput` is responsible to output a list of string lines. Some of the plain outputs are responsible to redirect
events to other plain outputs, like `multi` to output to multiple other outputs, `redirect`
to redirect output to other output conditionally. Some of them are terminal outputs like `noop` which does not do
anything, `console` which is used to output data using `print` statements and `file` which is used to output data to
file in the given directory path. File name is based on creating time with a prefix, postfix and extension which can be
changed of needed. File output can not be used on flutter web.

As a note filtering will always pass `init` and `close` operations. It is better to use `redirect` and its dialects for
enabling/disabling logging **completely** on different situations.

A basic example, which only logs on debug and outputs to cosnole using simple formatting:

```dart
import 'package:harmony_log/harmony_log.dart';

void main() {
  final log = Log(
    id: LogId(),
    child: LogOutput.redirectOnDebug(
      child: LogOutput.plain(
        format: LogPlainFormat.simple(),
        child: LogPlainOutput.console(),
      ),
    ),
  );
  log.init();
  log.i('hello, there!');
  log.e('bad code!', error: AssertionError());
  log.close();
}
```

A basic example, which only logs on debug and outputs to cosnole using pretty formatting, and also filtering logs to
have at least `info` level and using counter id generation:

```dart

final log = Log(
  id: LogId.counter(),
  child: LogOutput.redirectOnDebug(
    child: LogOutput.filtered(
      filter: LogFilter.level(LogLevel.info),
      child: LogOutput.plain(
        format: LogPlainFormat.pretty(),
        child: LogPlainOutput.console(),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

An example, which shows logs with level at least `debug` on cosole only in debug with pretty formatting, saves all logs
to a file with json formatting, on release sends logs with level of at least `error` to a server:

```dart

final log = Log(
  id: LogId.counter(),
  child: LogOutput.multi(
    children: [
      LogOutput.redirectOnDebug(
        child: LogOutput.filtered(
          filter: LogFilter.level(LogLevel.debug),
          child: LogOutput.plain(
            format: LogPlainFormat.simple(),
            child: LogPlainOutput.console(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      LogOutput.plan(
        format: LogPlainFormat.json(),
        child: LogPlainOutput.file(
          path: 'path/to/directory',
        ),
      ),
      LogOutput.redirectOnRelease(
        child: LogOutput.filtered(
          filter: LogFilter.level(LogLevel.error),
          child: LogOutput.custom(
            write: (e) {
              // send event to server
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

creating a tagged logger:

```dart

final log = Log(/* ... */);

final otherLog = log.tagged('OTHER');
```
